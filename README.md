This is a database of all molecules in official [Opus Magnum](https://www.zachtronics.com/opus-magnum/) puzzles as well as ones listed on <https://events.critelli.technology/> with the exception of [Alchademy](https://events.critelli.technology/collection/444), Speed Solve seasons [2](https://events.critelli.technology/collection/speedsolve2) and [3](https://events.critelli.technology/collection/speedsolve3), and the puzzle [End Game](https://events.critelli.technology/OM2023_W0_EndGame) from the 2023 tournament. These events and puzzles as well as earlier community events are not listed here because they didn't name their inputs and outputs. If a host of one of these events or an author of one of these puzzles would like to add molecule names for their puzzles to this database, please contact me (`@fenhl` on Discord, or [open an issue](https://github.com/fenhl/molecule-db/issues/new)). Also omitted are dynamic molecules such as the conditional inputs and outputs of computation puzzles or the input for [Tonic of Transmogrification](https://events.critelli.technology/OM2023Weeklies_TransTonic).

The database is up to date as of [Touch Grass](https://events.critelli.technology/OM2024Weeklies_TouchGrass), published 2024-08-31.
