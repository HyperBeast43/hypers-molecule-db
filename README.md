This is a database of all molecules in official [Opus Magnum](https://www.zachtronics.com/opus-magnum/) puzzles as well as ones listed on <https://events.critelli.technology/> with the exception of [Alchademy](https://events.critelli.technology/collection/444), Speed Solve seasons [2](https://events.critelli.technology/collection/speedsolve2) and [3](https://events.critelli.technology/collection/speedsolve3), and the puzzle [End Game](https://events.critelli.technology/OM2023_W0_EndGame) from the 2023 tournament. These events and puzzles as well as earlier community events are not listed here because they didn't name their inputs and outputs. If a host of one of these events or an author of one of these puzzles would like to add molecule names for their puzzles to this database, please contact me (`@fenhl` on Discord, or [open an issue](https://github.com/fenhl/molecule-db/issues/new)). Also omitted are dynamic molecules such as the conditional inputs and outputs of computation puzzles or the input for [Tonic of Transmogrification](https://events.critelli.technology/OM2023Weeklies_TransTonic).

The database is up to date as of [Thermic Capacitor](https://events.critelli.technology/om2025week2_Thermic_Capacitor), published 2025-01-10.

# Usage

The database frontend can be found at <https://mol.fenhl.net/> — you can either draw the atoms and bonds in the molecule builder tool to look up the names and appearances of the drawn molecule, or click “List of all molecules” below the builder to look up molecule shapes by name.

# Contributing

To add a missing molecule, draw it in the canvas, then click the “unknown molecule” text to copy its Rust code definition to the clipboard.
